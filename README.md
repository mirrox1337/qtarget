# qtarget 
## Overview
qTarget is a FiveM interaction / targeting solution that allows you to hold a key to activate a mode that will let players target specific objects or zones to be able to interact with. 

### Features 
* Support for Objects, PolyZones, EntityZones, and Entities
  * Future support planned for: Players, Peds, Vehicles, VehicleBones
* Passes data through to the event that is executed
* Utilizes `canInteract()`, a function you can define for each individual option to determine whether or not that option should be visible. 
* Utilizes `required_item`, which hooks into linden_inventory to check if you have an item before showing the option. 
* Utilizes a multi-functional `job` check per option, which can be a string or a table defining minimum grade to see an option.
* Disables combat while the interactive mode is active.
* Optimised to  an inch of its life - 0.04ms max recorded during testing. 

## Preface 
This is an actively developed resource. As such, it is to be expected that there are bugs, issues and - heaven forbid - breaking commits, occasionally. We will provide support for this resource, so long as you accept that this is currently a work in progress and not yet intended as a final product. 

With that being said, we're happy to release this resource as it is functional to a point matching or exceeding functionality to our previous forked versions of bt-target, which this resource is heavily based on, and uses the javascript from.
